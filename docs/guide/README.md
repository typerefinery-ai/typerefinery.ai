# Introduction

Knowledge graphs are one of the most important technologies of the 2020s. Gartner predicted that 
the applications of graph processing and graph databases will grow at 100% annually over the next 
few years.
Over the last two decades, this technology was adopted mostly by engineers and ontologists, hence 
the majority of knowledge graph tools were designed for the users with advanced programming 
skills.
In general, Knowledge graphs, need data to be imported and harmonised from multiple sources. 
Then algorithms, rules and reasoning are used to identify patterns of interest. In addition, 
visualisation tools are required to visually sort through all of the data, and sub-queries may result in 
standard charts (e.g. time-series, pie chart, bar chart etc.). Finally, various analytical methods are 
required to further extract insights.
All of this requires the development of considerable custom code, or very powerful no-code user 
interfaces. TypeDB is considerably differentiated from all other knowledge graphs, and has the 
potential to be a game changer, but it is relatively new and has limited capabilities in its no-code 
interface (TypeDB WorkBase).
The Type Explorer is designed as a superior replacement to the Grakn WorkBase.
